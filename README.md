# Welcome to new_project2!

## What this project is about
Testing out another project

## Basic Contributing Guidelines
- No derogatory slurs -- no oppressive language of any kind
- No mocking people with mental health problems
- This repo is owned by an individual who is in the Autistic/ADHDer/Neurodivergent community, and thus a part of the larger Disabled community.  Please do not spread ableist and anti-neurodivergent sentiment.
- Be sure to create new branches using `new_project2_` as a prefix to your branch.  It just makes it easier for me to see which project you are working on, since we have a `main` and `orphantest` branch.
- We will be putting branch protections requiring pull requests on the home branch for this project, `new_project2`.  Therefore, always use pull requests to merge a branch into `new_project2`.
- Create a pull request as soon as you create your branch.  When you think you are done with the branch and want a peer to review the content, just ping them on your GH pull request and/or DM.
- When creating pull requests, be sure you use `new_project2` as the base branch, and your branch as the compare branch.
