# Welcome to new_project2!

## What this project is about
Testing out another project

## Basic Contributing Guidelines
- Be sure to create new branches using `new_project2_` as a prefix to your branch.  It just makes it easier for me to see which project you are working on, since we have a `main` and `orphantest` branch.
- No derogatory slurs -- no oppressive language of any kind
- No mocking people with mental health problems
- We will be putting branch protections requiring pull requests on the home branch for this project, `new_project2`.  Therefore, always use pull requests to merge a branch into `new_project2`.
