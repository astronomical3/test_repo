Welcome to the main project of Hilarious Gibberish!

It's just a bunch of nonsense and gibberish, and I love it for what it is.

If you are on this repo, congratulations!  You are a contributor to this
project.

To make contributions, just clone this repo, and use branches to make any change.

Right now, I have 2 projects going on in the repo.
  - One is from the main branch.
  - An alternative project is on the orphantest branch.
  - Thus, you have a couple of choices available to you on what you want to contribute to.
  - Branch off of either one of these branches.

Just be sure to make pull requests when ready to merge a branch with main or orphantest.
  - IMPORTANT! If doing the project off of the orphantest branch, be sure the base branch
    in the pull request is orphantest, and not main, before you submit your request.
  - Otherwise, I will automatically close the pull request and ask you to submit another
    one correctly.  Thanks
