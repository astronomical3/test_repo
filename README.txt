Welcome to the orphantest project of Hilarious Gibberish!

It's still a bunch of nonsense and gibberish, but even more of it.

Just be sure to make pull requests when ready to merge a branch with orphantest.
  - IMPORTANT! If doing the project off of the orphantest branch, be sure the base branch in the pull request is orphantest, and not main, before you submit your request.
  - Otherwise, I will automatically close the pull request and ask you to submit another one correctly.

If you do not want to work on this project, we still have the main project. Just checkout the main branch.

Lastly, when branching off of orphantest from now on, use the orphantest name as a namespace, followed by a _, and then your branch name, so I can see what exact project you are working on.
